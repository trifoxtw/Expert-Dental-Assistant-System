## Project Overview
This project aims to create an intelligent dental assistant system that can help patients manage their dental health efficiently. The system provides features such as appointment scheduling, treatment reminders, and educational resources on dental health.

## System Architecture
The architecture of the Expert Dental Assistant System consists of multiple modules:

- **User Interface**: A web-based interface for patients and dental professionals.
- **Backend API**: A RESTful API that handles requests from the front end and interacts with the database.
- **Database**: A relational database storing user data, appointments, and treatment records.
- **Notification Service**: A microservice that sends reminders and notifications to users.
- **Analytics Service**: A module for analyzing user data to provide insights and recommendations.

The system is designed with scalability and security in mind, so it can handle a growing number of users and ensure data privacy.
